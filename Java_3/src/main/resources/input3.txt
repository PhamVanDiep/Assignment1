The car is one of the most popular inventions in the world every day. It is one of the successful inventions in approximating distances and shortening time.

When thinking about how much time is saved for each person according to his daily use, we find that it is very fruitful for those who have daily work in remote and different areas, as it saves time of going and returning.

It is also very useful in snowy countries or that contain a vast desert, where it has become a safe means of transportation everywhere. It also greatly reduces the risks that a person can face under normal circumstances.

Therefore, I find the car very useful and important. The more protection and safety means are developed, cars become more important than before.
