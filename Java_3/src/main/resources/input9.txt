Composition about a car

The dangers of cars to humans and the environment

Traffic Accidents: There is no doubt that traffic accidents are one of the most important causes of death for many people. Also, people who are injured in traffic accidents may lose some of their organs and live in permanent pain.
Pollution of the environment: Transportation means of all kinds pollute the environment, as they emit carbon dioxide and other gases harmful to human health.
Traffic congestion: As a result of the large number of cars used, especially in cities, traffic congestion has become a major problem that many cities of the world suffer from.
Despite the dangers of cars to humans and the environment, their benefits and importance in our lives outweigh their dangers.

Governments must try hard to solve the problems that lead to traffic accidents, environmental pollution, or congestion.
